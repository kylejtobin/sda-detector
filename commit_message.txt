feat: Complete modern Python development environment setup

Transform basic Python project into professional SDA development environment:

## Project Configuration
- Add pyproject.toml with Python 3.12, Pydantic v2, and SDA-optimized tooling
- Configure Ruff (linting/formatting), MyPy (strict typing), Pytest (testing)
- Set up proper dependency separation (production vs dev dependencies)
- Add uv.lock for reproducible builds

## Development Tooling  
- Add Makefile with smart uv installation and common development tasks
- Create .vscode/ configuration for optimal Python development experience
- Configure VS Code extensions and settings for SDA patterns
- Set up test infrastructure with coverage reporting

## Key Features
- Universal uv setup (Linux/macOS/WSL compatible)
- Clean virtual environment with Python 3.12.11
- Type-driven development with strict MyPy + Pydantic plugin
- Fast development cycle with Ruff sub-second linting
- Professional project structure following modern Python standards

This establishes the foundation for building SDA analysis tools while
demonstrating the architectural principles we're creating detectors for.

Ready for semantic domain architecture development! ðŸš€
