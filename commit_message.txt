feat: Achieve 100% type safety with teaching-focused documentation and enhanced SDA workflow

## Perfect Development Tooling
- Fix all MyPy strict mode violations (19 errors → 0)
- Achieve 100% Ruff compliance with consistent formatting
- Add comprehensive return type annotations to all methods
- Implement proper type guards for AST attribute access

## Enhanced Type Safety & SDA Improvements
- Add `-> None` annotations to all visit methods and helpers
- Fix Any return types in `extract_name()` with explicit `str()` casts
- Resolve union type conflicts with explicit `dict[str, list[str]]` annotations
- Remove all `.value` usage on StrEnum instances (10 violations → 0)
- Use StrEnum directly since it auto-converts to string
- Improve self-analysis score: 77.0% → 81.6% patterns

## Teaching-Focused Documentation Excellence
- Maintain exceptional docstring teaching philosophy throughout
- Preserve "SDA Philosophy (Teaching Guide)" explanations
- Keep "Junior Dev Tutorial" sections for AST concepts
- Retain "This demonstrates SDA" explicit teaching moments
- Document why boundary code differs from domain code

## Enhanced Development Workflow
- Add `make self-analyze` command for convenient dogfooding
- Add `make run FILE=path` command for analyzing any file
- Fix `make setup` to use `uv sync` instead of outdated commands
- Update README with VS Code interpreter troubleshooting
- Add comprehensive make command documentation

## Code Quality Metrics
- MyPy: Success (strict mode, 0 errors)
- Ruff: All checks passed (perfect formatting)
- SDA Score: 81.6% patterns, 18.4% violations
- 16 computed fields, 7 Pydantic models, 3 behavioral enums
- Zero manual JSON serialization violations
- Demonstrate core SDA principle: "enums that ARE values, not HAVE values"

This commit transforms the SDA detector into a reference implementation
for type-driven development with teaching-quality documentation that
demonstrates the very architectural principles it analyzes.
