# üîç SDA COMPLIANCE VALIDATION PROTOCOL

## MISSION: Enforce 100% SDA Compliance Across Entire Codebase

### MANDATORY VALIDATION CHECKLIST

**1. RUN COMPLIANCE COMMANDS (MUST PASS):**
```bash
# Type Safety - MUST return success
mypy --strict src/sda_detector/
mypy --strict tests/

# Linting - MUST be clean
ruff check src/ tests/
ruff format --check src/ tests/

# BANNED CONSTRUCTS - MUST return EMPTY (except justified boundaries)
grep -r "isinstance" src/ tests/ --include="*.py" | grep -v "# Boundary"
grep -r "hasattr" src/ tests/ --include="*.py" | grep -v "# Boundary"
grep -r "getattr" src/ tests/ --include="*.py" | grep -v "# Boundary"
grep -r "cast" src/ tests/ --include="*.py"
grep -r "type: ignore" src/ tests/ --include="*.py" | grep -v "# SDA:"

# CONDITIONALS REVIEW - Check for business logic violations
grep -r "if " src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v "__name__" | grep -v "# Boundary"
grep -r "match " src/ --include="*.py"
grep -r "try:" src/ --include="*.py" | grep -v "# Infrastructure"
```

**2. VERIFY DISCRIMINATED UNION PATTERNS:**
- ‚úÖ ALL enums have behavioral methods
- ‚úÖ Pure dictionary/tuple dispatch (no if/elif chains)
- ‚úÖ Result types instead of exceptions
- ‚úÖ Literal discriminators for unions
- ‚úÖ StrEnum for all domain concepts (no string literals)
- ‚úÖ Constructive transformation at boundaries

**3. VERIFY ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE:**
- ‚úÖ **Models**: Contain business logic and decisions
- ‚úÖ **Services**: Pure orchestration, no conditionals
- ‚úÖ **Boundaries**: Single extraction point, immediate conversion
- ‚úÖ **Immutability**: All models frozen by default
- ‚úÖ **Computed Fields**: For derived intelligence only
- ‚úÖ **Type Dispatch**: Discriminated unions for ALL branching

**4. VERIFY CONSTRUCTIVE PROOF PATTERN:**
```python
# Every type transformation MUST follow this pattern:
# 1. Unpack components explicitly
# 2. Transform individually to domain types
# 3. Reconstruct target type (construction IS validation)
```

**5. PROVIDE PROOF OF COMPLIANCE:**
Show evidence of:
- mypy --strict output: "Success: no issues found"
- ruff check output: "All checks passed!"
- grep results for banned constructs: EMPTY
- Self-analysis with sda-detector: 95%+ compliance

**6. IDENTIFY ANY VIOLATIONS:**
For ANY SDA violations found:
- Exact file and line numbers
- Specific violation type from PatternType enum
- Discriminated union replacement implementation
- Justification if boundary operation

## BOUNDARY OPERATION JUSTIFICATION
Allowed ONLY at external system boundaries with explicit comment:
```python
func = getattr(node, 'func', None)  # Boundary operation - AST interface
```

## EXPECTED RESULT: 100% SDA COMPLIANCE
- Zero isinstance/hasattr/getattr (except justified boundaries)
- Zero if/elif for business logic
- Zero match/case statements
- Zero try/except for control flow
- Zero cast() usage
- Zero naked primitives
- Zero business logic in services

**FAILURE TO ACHIEVE 100% COMPLIANCE = IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED**

## SELF-DOGFOODING TEST
```bash
# The ultimate test - can we detect our own violations?
python -m src.sda_detector src/sda_detector --verbose
```

Expected output: 95%+ SDA patterns, <5% violations (only boundary operations)
